This is done by asking the experts to agree how certain they are as a group that the MOE is greater than 1, given that all identified (non-standard or standard) sources of uncertainty has been resolved.\nThis can be done by reaching a consensus judgement (following procedures for expert knowledge elicitation using behavioural aggregation)\nThis judgement requires expertise on both toxicity and exposure assessment.\nThis is a useful option when the Highest Exposure is far below the Reference Point.\n\n\nRefined option with probability bounds\nA refined approach is needed when there is a small difference between the Reference Point and the Highest Exposure.\nA refined option is to assess uncertainties separately before combining them by calculations and assessing overall uncertainty.\nFirst we explore how to do this with probability bounds.\nIn this example, the experts are asked to express their uncertainty in the Reference Point and in a High Exposure for adults in the EU.\nThe experts judge that they are 95% certain that the Reference Point is above 0.062 μg iAs/kg bw per day.\n\\[P(RP &gt; 0.062) = 0.95\\]\n\n\n\nP below\nvalue\nP above\n\n\n\n\n5%\n0.062\n95%\n\n\n\nIn some situations, RP is the BMDL and then it is difficult to talk about RP as some other value. If so, one can introduce an uncertainty factor (UF) that considers uncertainty associated with the hazard assessment. The focus is then on \\(RP/UF\\) instead of \\(RP\\).\nThe experts then judge that they are 90% certain that a High Exposure is below 0.33 μg iAs/kg bw per day.\n\\[P( HE &lt; 0.33) = 0.90\\]\n\n\n\nP below\nvalue\nP above\n\n\n\n\n90%\n0.33\n10%\n\n\n\nThen we use probability bounds analysis (and the rule of “lost probabilities” as described in the third video) to calculate that it is at least \\[ 100 - [(100-95)+(100-90)]=85\\%\\] probable that the ratio of the highest estimate of High Exposure to the Reference Point is less than or equal than 0.33/0.062 = 5.32\n\\[P(\\frac{HE}{RP} &lt; 5.32) \\geq 85\\%\\]\n\n\n\nP below\nvalue\nP above\n\n\n\n\n\\(\\leq 15\\%\\)\n5.32\n\\(\\geq 85\\%\\)\n\n\n\n\nGo through the calculations for the lost probability rule and try to understand what it does.\n\nUnfortunately, this result is not enough to reach a conclusion whether a High Exposure is below the Reference Point (i.e. that the MOE is greater than 1). See the callout box how the refined option with probability bounds can be designed to consider what level of certainty that is required.\n\nThe refined option with probability bounds can be modified to consider the probability threshold for a “firm conclusion” (also known as the level for practical certainty). In this example, the risk managers and the experts have agreed that experts must be at least 90% certain that a High Exposure \\(HE\\) is below the Reference Point \\(RP\\) in order for risk managers to make a decision.\nThis means that the assessment is conclusive when the experts are at least 90% certain that there is a health concern or that they are at least 90% certain that there is no a health concern.\n\nSubtract the probability threshold from 100% to set an upper bound for the the sum of the lost probabilities.\n\nE.g. \\(100\\% - 90\\% = 10\\%\\)\n\nDivide this into two parts, one for exposure and one for hazard.\n\nE.g. \\(5\\%\\) and \\(5\\%\\)\n\nSubtract the lost probability for exposure from 100, to set the probability required for a conservative estimate of a High Exposure.\n\nE.g. \\(100\\% - 5\\% = 95\\%\\)\n\nElicit a conservative estimate of a High Exposure from the exposure experts (asking them to consider the identified sources of uncertainty for the exposure assessment).\n\nE.g. \\(P(HE &lt; x) = 95\\%\\)\n\nSubtract the lost probability for hazard from 100, to set the probability required for a conservative estimate of the Reference Point.\n\nE.g. \\(100\\% - 5\\% = 95\\%\\)\n\nElicit a conservative estimate of the Reference Point (or RP/UF) from the toxicology experts (asking them to consider the identified sources of uncertainty for the hazard assessment).\n\nE.g. \\(P(RP &lt; y) = 95\\%\\)\n\nDivide the conservative estimate for the exposure with the conservative estimate for the hazard\n\n\\(\\frac{x}{y}\\)\n\nIf the ratio is less than the threshold on MOE, then there is sufficient certainty for a firm conclusion that exposure is below the hazardous concentration.\n\nE.g. Is \\(\\frac{x}{y} &lt; 1\\)?\n\nIf it is not possible to conclude with high enough certainty, we move on to a refined option for uncertainty analysis with probability distributions or consider collecting more data.\n\n\nRefined option with probability distributions\nA refined option can alternatively be done with with probability distributions which are combined by Monte Carlo simulation.\nThis is an option, when the outcome of a probability bound analysis was not conclusive.\nIt can also be an option when the assessors prefers to choose to justify probability distributions for uncertainty from available information, combine uncertainties by performing the probability calculations, and then ask the experts to make a judgement on the outcome of interest directly. Note that an explicit elicitation of the outcome of interest following the Monte Carlo simulation is a condition for this approach to result in a characterisation of the experts uncertainty considering the combined impact of all sources of uncertainty in the assessment.\nA probability distribution representing uncertainty in the Reference Point can be taken from the BMD uncertainty distribution generated by bootstrapping or Bayesian modelling.\nHere is an example of what it looks like when using the EFSA BMD software:\n\nWe let the BMDL, the BMD, and the BMDU define the 5th percentile (P05), the median (P50), and the 95th percentile (P95) of the probability distribution for uncertainty in the RP.\n\n\n\nBMDL\nBMD\nBMDU\n\n\n\n\nP05\nP50\nP95\n\n\n0.062\n0.147\n0.21\n\n\n\n\nGo to the online elicitation app for one distribution link to SHELF app and find a probability distribution that matches these quantiles. Note that you have to specify the lower and upper bound of the plausible range. You can get them from studying the previous graph from the EFSA BMD software.\n\nCOMMENT: Ths approach ignores additional sources of uncertainty than those considered in the model, hence we need to draft how to consider those as well. e.g. by adjusting the specification of the quantiles.\n\nYou can find the R-code to generate random numbers from the selected probability distribution in the report that is possible to download from SHELF\n\n\nAs an example, the remaining instructions will use the distribution selected by me. You can replace the code with your own distribution or use mine. I used 0 and 0.23 as the plausible range and selected a generalised beta-distribution over the interval 0 and 0.23 for which random draws can be generated by\n\n0.23 * rbeta(n = 10, shape1 = 3.15, shape2 = 1.92)\n\n [1] 0.19919128 0.13549717 0.19442549 0.17839767 0.21490435 0.13235737\n [7] 0.12290276 0.06970841 0.15147124 0.13973874\n\n\nThis beta-distribution is defined as\n\\(\\frac{RP}{0.23} \\sim beta(3.15, 1.92)\\)\n\nIf you have a different distribution, specify it with a similar format RP ~ … (ask for help)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerate 10 000 random numbers from the probability distribution for the RP and save it into an object named rp.\n\nLet us visualise the sample from the distribution in a histogram.\n\n\n\n\n\nA probability distribution representing uncertainty in the estimates of High Exposure over different surveys can be specified by assuming that the range of the dietary exposure estimates corresponds to the bounds of an 80% probability interval.\n\n\n\nmin HE\nmax HE\n\n\n\n\nP10\nP90\n\n\n0.07\n0.33\n\n\n\nOne choice could be to use a normal distribution to represent uncertainty in a High Exposure. A normal distribution has two parameters, the mean (\\(\\mu\\)) and the standard deviation (\\(\\sigma\\)).\n\\[HE \\sim N(\\mu,\\sigma)\\]\nWe derive the mean by taking the mid value in the range\n\\[ \\mu = \\frac{0.33+0.07}{2}= 0.2\\] The standard deviation is specified by considering the formula for a 90% quantile in the normal distributions as a function of the parameters.\n\\[ P90 = \\mu + 1.28\\cdot \\sigma\\]\nand rearranging it to be a function of \\(\\sigma\\)\n\\[ \\sigma = \\frac{P90 - \\mu}{1.28} =  \\frac{0.33-0.13}{1.28}=0.1\\]\nSpecification of the parameters and draw of random numbers from the normal distribution\n\nm = (0.07+0.33)/2\ns = (0.33-m)/qnorm(0.9)\n\nhe = rnorm(n = niter, mean = m, sd = s)\nhe[he&lt;0] = 0 # truncate\n\n\nAt the end of the above chunck we truncate the values. What does that mean? Why is a normal distribution not an ideal choice in this case?\n\nThe distributions for High Exposure and the Reference Point overlap.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe calculated probability that the MOE is above 1 is 30 %.\n\nCalculate the proportion of random samples in your Monte Carlo simulation that corresponds to a MOE &gt; 1.\n\n\nmoe = rp/he\nmean(moe&gt;1)\n\n\n\nVisualise the resulting distribution for uncertainty in MOE with your choice of distributions.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIn my analysis, the distribution for MOE looks weird. The reason is that the probability distribution for exposure generates values that are zero or close to zero, and when we divide by that the MOE is extremely large.\nUncertainty in the ratio HE over RP (i.e. 1/MOE) offers a better visualisation of the generated distribution.\n\nConsider, revising the visualisation but for 1/MOE using the code below.\n\n\ndf &lt;- density(he/rp, from=0)\ndf &lt;- data.frame(x=df$x,y=df$y)\nggplot(data.frame(x=df$x,y=df$y),aes(x=x, y=y)) +\n  geom_line() +\n  geom_ribbon(data=subset(df,x&lt;1),  aes(x=x,ymax=y),ymin=0,fill=\"red\", alpha=0.5) +\n  xlab(\"1/MOE\") +\n  ylab(\"density\") +\n  ggtitle(\"Uncertainty in 1/MOE\", subtitle=paste0(\"P(MOE&gt;1)=\",round(mean(rp/he&gt;1)*100),\"%\"))\n\n\n\n\nThe red area corresponds to a MOE greater than 1.\nAs a final step, the experts are invited to adjust this probability upwards or downwards considering additional sources of uncertainty, not previously taken into account in the analysis.\nFor the purpose of this exercise we assume that the experts subsequently judged that any additional sources of uncertainty were small enough that there was no need to adjust the calculated % probability that the MOE is above 1.\nAn additional sources of uncertainty could e.g. be the choice of distributions used in the Monte Carlo simulation and any limitations in the quality of the exposure and toxicity data that are not taken into account in those distributions."
