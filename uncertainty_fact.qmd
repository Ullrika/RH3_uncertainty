## Overview

The purpose of an uncertainty analysis is to identify sources of uncertainty and evaluate their combined impact on the experts uncertainty in a categorical outcome of interest (a fact according to the terminology by van de Bles et al. 2019).

This page describe an approach to quantify uncertainty exemplified by hazard identification.

A tiered uncertainty analysis can be

-   an expert judgement on the outcome of interest directly

-   an expert judgement on the outcome of interest considering uncertainties in streams of evidence (expressed qualitatively with rules how to combine them)

-   an expert judgement on the outcome of interest considering uncertainties in streams of evidence (expressed quantitatively and a model how to combine them)

## Qualitative approaches

Approaches resulting in a qualitative expression of uncertainty in hazard identification exists. These are also based on expert judgement, but where uncertainty is expressed qualitatively.

A qualitative expression for uncertainty is more open for different interpretations compared to a quantitative expression on a well-defined scale.

Qualitative expressions for uncertainty are helpful when making a judgement on the combined impact of sources to uncertainty.

A qualitative expression of uncertainty in the hazard identification can be sufficient if this goes into a continued assessment, but if hazard identification is the only assessment or there is a conclusion to be made on the hazard identification before proceeding to the next step, then a quantitative expression of uncertainty is to recommend.

## Practical certainty

```{r}
p_DM = 90
```

The risk managers has informed the risk assessors that they find a certainty of `r p_DM`% or more as acceptable for decision making. This is know as **practical certainty**. It can be sufficient to conclude if overall uncertainty is in the range of practical certainty.

| No association  | Inconclusive            | Association |
|-----------------|-------------------------|-------------|
| \<`r 100-p_DM`% | `r 100-p_DM` - `r p_DM` | \>`r p_DM`% |

If not, the assessment should be reported as **inconclusive**. The risk managers can then decide to support generation of new studies to fill data gaps and perform a re-evaluation of the risk assessment.

A probability threshold for a "firm conclusion" opens up to communicate conclusion as a health concern or no health concern, or inconclusive.

## Outcome Qualitative -\> Qualitative

***Hazard Identification Conclusion*** is a conclusion on evidence linking an exposure to a health outcome: (1) known to be a hazard to humans (2) presumed to be a hazard to humans (3) suspected to be a hazard to humans (4) not classifiable as a hazard to humans (5) not identified as a hazard to humans

After screening for relevant studies the conclusions is reach in a step-wise procedure:

Source of evidence (individual studies) are evaluated individually by critical appraisal on a qualitative scale (Very Low, Low, Moderate to High confidence in the body of evidence).

The sources are synthesised and the quality in the body of evidence is evaluated on a qualitative scale (Very Low, Low, Moderate and High confidence in the body of evidence).

The confidence ratings are translated into level of evidence of health effects (Inadequate, Low, Moderate and High for a health effect or no health effect)

This is done for the Level of Evidence for Health Effects in Human Studies and Level of Evidence for Health Effects in Non-Human Animal Studies separately.

## Qualitative and quantitative

Turn qualitative judgement on the body of evidence into a quantitative judgement on the certainty of a Health effect

### Starting with 50% probability for a Health effect

UK framework -- Could result in precise or approximate

### Starting with 0-100% probability of a Health effect

Shrink the approximate probability

## Fully quantitative

Quality of evidence -\> Quantitative likelihood function

Proceed with prior + likelihood -\> Posterior

How to assign a certain number to a category - need be careful

How to combine likelihoods from different studies

Translate Very Low - High into likelihood

If categorical evidence

If continuous quantity from meta analysis (effect size)
